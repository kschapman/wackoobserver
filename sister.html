    <div class="text">
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Writer/Director:</strong> Kenneth Chapman</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama -> Thriller</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Proposed Budget:</strong> 100 – 150K</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Location:</strong> Can be shot entirely in a studio or suitable apartment on location.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Logline:</strong> <em>When Tayla and Brooke visit their younger sister Emere, a washed up alcoholic actress to stage an intervention to get her sober, their night takes a sadistic turn when Bonny and Hailee, two teenage girls, invade Emere’s apartment and stage an intervention of their own.</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">What starts as a fully developing drama about three sisters trying to reconnect as a family, SISTER, PLEASE turns into a thriller at the hands of two teenage girls, ultimately bringing Emere, Tayla and Brooke closer together through a shared traumatic experience and bringing the drama that was opened up in the first half full circle.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Characters:</strong></p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>EMERE (29): </strong>A once highly acclaimed actress who wasn’t ready for the attention. Having turned to alcohol during her first year of fame in Hollywood, Emere failed to hold a professional attitude and is now only offered small independent movies that exploit her combination of former fame and current willingness to take on nude roles. At only 29, she is already considered a has-been in the industry.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>BROOKE (31): </strong>A confident and candidly speaking criminal lawyer and the oldest of the sisters. It is Brooke’s idea to stage an intervention to get Emere sober. Brooke has kept her sexuality (gay) a secret for fear of losing her relationship with her parents. Only Emere knows about it.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>TAYLA (30): </strong>Six weeks pregnant and happily married. Tayla owns an organic food restaurant in Los Angeles. The more calm and soft-spoken of the sisters, Tayla tries, often failing, to keep the peace between Brooke and Emere who have a dark history together.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>BONNY (16): </strong>As intelligent as she is sadistic, Bonny was once Emere’s biggest fan until her career fell apart. She has a cunning and violent plan to put Emere through a traumatic event that she believes in her heart will change the direction of her career so she can once again be her biggest fan.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>LINDA (mid 40’s): </strong>Sariska’s mother. Very supportive of her daughter’s fighting ambitions. Knows her friendship with Scott very well and an emotional pillar for her daughter.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>HAILEE (15): </strong>Bonny’s younger sister and accomplice, Hailee is along for the ride but doesn’t feed off the power and control like Bonny so loses interest fast. Is more excited by the idea of changing Emere’s career than actually going through with the actions required in their plan.</p>
