      <p class="description-hozho">Sariska is a moving story of teen love and friendship that combines the heart of The Fault in Our Stars and the raw energy of a film like Thirteen.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho">Knocking out a grown man in an alleyway to save a woman from being mugged, a confident seventeen year old MMA fighter (Sariska) is hired, along with her best friend (Scott), to protect the woman’s daughter (Mary) at the high school parties she frequents. They quickly form a strong and violent rivalry with a group of boys at school who are solely out to intoxicate girls like Mary so they can sleep with them. As Scott begins to fall in love with Mary, a love triangle forms when Sariska’s true feelings for Scott come to the surface. As the rivalry with the boys reaches dangerous heights and both romantic and physical stakes begin to overflow, everything reaches a grand climax at the biggest party of the year where both hearts and cheekbones are broken with equal force.</p>
