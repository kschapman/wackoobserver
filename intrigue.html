She describes a challenging childhood, her travels which include living in Botswana for two years and having her first child there to studying at university later in life and now painting everyday.

Jinx tells of childhood in Austria, experiences in lucid dreaming, her creative process in painting and the inspiration behind a lot of her work so far. We discuss a lot of her paintings individually on the show which you can view on her website.

                Bex currently owns and operates the Willis York hair salon. I had the pleasure of meeting her at the salon while doing some filming there. After talking to her for no more than a couple minutes before having to leave, I felt, as I do with some of the people I meet every now and then, that I just had to hear her story. Something about her really struck something in me and she kindly agreed to be the first guest on the show. In part one of her story, Bex takes us through her experiences growing up down south, school girl crushes, life at boarding school and falling in love with music.<br><br>
