    <div class="text">
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Writer/Director:</strong> Kenneth Chapman</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Genre:</strong> Drama</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Proposed Budget:</strong> $3-5 million </p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Location:</strong> Wimbledon, urban + country (flexible) </p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Logline:</strong> <em>When her twin brother and mixed doubles partner collapses during championship point at Wimbledon and ends up in a coma, an obsessive athlete is forced to adjust to normal life in order to take care of her brother and faces her biggest challenge with the shocking revelation of the person he becomes when he recovers.</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>The Film/Brief Synopsis:</strong></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">An ambitious sports/romance drama set in three parts with three distinct dramatic tones and colour palettes. Michael and Marie Bradley, the two leads, offer huge emotional character arcs and the opportunity for two actors to go to truly great depths.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><em>Pt. 1 (White): Sports drama.</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">Michael and Marie prepare for Wimbledon on their estate with another mixed doubles team. We come privy to Michael sleeping with a lot of the women who work on the estate and his laid back attitude in comparison to Marie’s very structured and focused demeanour. During championship point at Wimbledon, as Marie tosses to serve out the tournament, Michael collapses and hits his head hard when he lands.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><em>Pt. 2 (Red): Hospital drama/romance.</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">Marie retires from tennis to stay with Michael full time in the hospital where he’s in a state of total locked in syndrome and unable to communicate in any way. When Marie tells Michael that she’s fallen in love with Andrew, the doctor supervising his case, he makes his first physical movement and the promise of a recovery.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><em>Pt. 3 (Blue): Domestic drama.</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">Four years later, Michael, no longer sporting a care free attitude but now a serious, non-talkative one, overdoses on his prescription medication at the reception of Marie and Michael’s wedding. We find out that Michael suffered temporary memory loss during his time in total locked in syndrome and came to believe that Marie was his girlfriend or wife and fell in love with her while he was immobile. Marie forces Michael into therapy in an effort to get her brother back to how he was before. As hard as Michael tries through therapy and training for tennis again, he can’t shake the love he feels for his sister, as much as it disgusts him now that he knows she’s family. When Michael finally reveals the shocking truth to Marie, she forces him to leave her life until he’s ready to just be her brother again.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><em>Epilogue:</em></p>
      <p class="description-hozho">Two years later, Michael, now a successful singles tennis player, is leaving the changing room at Wimbledon and walking out onto centre court, this time on his own.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>Characters:</strong></p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>MARIE BRADLEY (late twenties): </strong>A greatly determined tennis player, Marie makes up one half of the mixed doubles team with her brother Michael. Promising herself she’ll retire from tennis once they win a Wimbledon title, she falls in love with Michaels doctor Andrew as she struggles to live life off the court and support her brother as he recovers in hospital.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>MICHAEL BRADLEY (late twenties): </strong>A ladies man who continues to play tennis only because his sister needs him there on her side for mixed doubles. A raw physical talent who the world believes should be playing singles, not mixed doubles.</p>
      <p class="description-hozho"><strong>ANDREW WHITE (late twenties): </strong>The doctor supervising Michael’s case, Andrew has not been in a relationship since he graduated from medical school and drowned himself in his career. Marie changes all that when she brings Michael into the hospital and Andrew falls fast in love with her.</p>
